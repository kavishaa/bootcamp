Assignment 4
The goal is to have a navigable flow that unifies your previous assignments  and create a mini website

Overview
========
- For you to complete this assignment ,please make sure you have the finder page ,product page & cart & cart confirm page.


Details
=======
- User starts his interaction from the finder page ,when he selects an item it loads the product page for that item,(it can be through a panel or load the product page) .

- On the product page a user can add the product to cart (the quantity & item details should be stored in a cookie)

- as the user moves to the cart & cart confirm ,he can select his payment or shipping details,all this data should be pulled from a JSON.

- No flat html pages ,the page should be split between reusable components 

- reuse the header and footer from Assignment1 to complete this assignment 

- Code should be checked in with the correct directory structure (views should be the views folder etc)  and use the right format for the JSON file .

- As with all assignments, you need to ensure the implementation adheres closely to the mock-up in a wide variety of browsers. For this assignment, consider IE 9+, Firefox 18+, and Chrome 25+ as browsers you must support.

- Don't take short-cuts on the page implementation; implement the page as you think a real production webpage should be structured.

- Demonstrate your best efforts to use front-end optimization best practices.
 
- create cookies and leverage web storage to store user preference for the cart

- None of the text should be implemented using bitmaps; real type should be used. Be thoughtful about choosing fonts that best represent the aesthetic of the design; consider using web fonts if appropriate.

- For shipping and credit card details create mock data in a JSON file and use that on the cart confirm page.

- all the JSON files should be loaded using a server (i.e., it may take several seconds to load). This means the page should not block on loading the file and should display some indication to the user that it is loading data.

- Feel free to use third-party libraries for whatever functionality you wish, but be sensitive to overall page size.
